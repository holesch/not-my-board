# This is a Place Specification and is used to filter the Places registered
# in the Board Farm. The Agent uses this Specification to reserve one of the
# matching Places.
# A Place matches, when all Parts match. A Part matches, when:
# - the tags in "compatible" are a subset of the exported Part
# - all USB and TCP interfaces are available (matched by name, like "usb0")

[parts.pi]
compatible = [ "raspberry-pi" ]
# Attach the two exported USB devices to the local USB Virtual Host
# Controller Interface using USB/IP.
usb.usb0 = { vhci_port = 0 }
usb.serial = { vhci_port = 1 }

[parts.power]
compatible = [ "my-power-supply" ]
# Listen on localhost:5025 and forward connections to the actual power
# supply attached to the exporter.
tcp.scpi = { local_port = 5025 }
